# ITJuana SDE Code Exercise

Made by Mario Andres Ruiz Navejas.

## Building

Use the latest version of Android Studio with JAVA.

Go to:
Build -> Build Bundle/APK -> Build APK

Navigate to /Itjuana/app/build/intermediates/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
to find the build apk. 

Note: There's already a running build there, so this step is not necessary.

## Installation

Copy the build file generated to an Android smartphone running Android 5.0 or later.
Open the file on your Android phone to install it.

## Debugging

An easier approach to run the app is to use Android Studio built in debugger.
Just connect an Android Phone in developer mode or use the built in simulator, and hit the play button on the top bar.
